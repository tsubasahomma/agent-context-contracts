# Artifact Contracts

This document defines the portable artifact model for durable outputs produced,
reviewed, or consumed during agent collaboration.

Portable artifact rules describe what must be true of durable artifacts without
embedding repository identity, local commands, host details, secret-adjacent
facts, adapter payloads, or sync metadata.

## Terms

- **Durable artifact**: an intentional output that is preserved, reviewable, and
  reusable beyond the immediate conversation turn or tool invocation.
- **Transient conversation context**: chat messages, scratch notes, exploratory
  tool output, intermediate reasoning, or temporary state that has not been
  captured as a durable artifact with metadata and evidence references.
- **Artifact producer**: the person, agent, process, or tool that creates or
  updates an artifact.
- **Artifact consumer**: the person, agent, process, tool, adapter, evaluator, or
  sync workflow that relies on an artifact.
- **Evidence reference**: a pointer to source material, inspected state,
  validation output, or maintainer confirmation that supports an artifact claim
  without requiring the artifact to embed all source material.

## Durable Artifact Model

A durable artifact MUST be distinguishable from transient conversation context.
It MUST be intentionally named, stored, or reported in a form that later
consumers can inspect without replaying the full conversation that produced it.

Durable artifacts MAY include:

- portable contract documents;
- project-local extension documents;
- adapter-specific payloads or templates;
- validation reports and validation claim sets;
- evidence summaries or evidence packs;
- evaluation reports;
- sync reports or sync metadata summaries.

This model describes the portable expectations shared by those artifact kinds.
It does not make every artifact portable core content. The artifact boundary is
defined by the artifact's ownership layer:

| Ownership layer | Artifact responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Portable core | Reusable contract rules and artifact metadata expectations. |
| Project-local extension | Repository-local artifact names, storage conventions, validation commands, and operational facts. |
| Adapter | Platform-specific or tool-specific payload shape, template format, and copied entry points. |
| Sync metadata | Managed-file state, checksums, installed adapter records, and update bookkeeping. |
| Evidence-packing tooling | Tool-specific collection, serialization, compression, or packing behavior. |

Transient conversation context MAY inform an artifact, but it MUST NOT be treated
as a durable artifact until the relevant claims, provenance, limitations, and
evidence references are captured in a durable location or report.

## Required Portable Metadata

Every durable artifact MUST make the following metadata available either
directly or through an owning layer that consumers can inspect, such as the
artifact body, an adjacent manifest, an owning index, a validation report, or a
change record:

| Metadata | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `artifact_id` or stable locator | Identifies the artifact for later reference. It MUST be stable within the artifact set and MUST NOT rely on host-absolute paths. |
| `artifact_kind` | Identifies the artifact category or ownership layer. Extension-specific kinds SHOULD be namespaced by their owning layer. |
| `schema_version` or governing contract | Identifies the schema or contract version the artifact follows. Narrative artifacts without a machine schema MUST still identify the governing contract or document set when practical. |
| `title` or purpose statement | States what the artifact is for. |
| `intended_consumers` | Names the expected audience or consumer classes. |
| `producer` | Identifies the producing role, process, or tool at the level needed for review without requiring personal or host-specific identity in portable core files. |
| `created_or_updated` | Provides enough freshness information for consumers to judge whether the artifact may be stale. |
| `provenance` | Summarizes the inputs, transformations, and decisions that shaped the artifact. |
| `evidence_refs` | Points to the source evidence that supports material claims. |
| `limitations` | States known limits, exclusions, uncertainty, and residual risks. |
| `validation_refs` | Points to validation claims or reports when validation exists or is required. |

Metadata MAY be represented as front matter, structured fields, a table, prose,
or an external manifest. Machine-consumed artifacts SHOULD use structured fields
with stable names. Human-consumed narrative artifacts MAY use prose when the same
information remains clear and reviewable.

Portable core files MUST NOT add repository-local identifiers, maintainer
identifiers, host-absolute paths, local command lines, secrets policy details, or
vendor-specific baseline assumptions merely to satisfy metadata fields. When
such details are necessary, they belong in a project-local extension, adapter
artifact, validation report, or sync report owned by that layer.

## Schema And Version Expectations

Artifacts with machine-consumed structure MUST declare a `schema_version`.
Consumers MUST NOT infer a structured schema version from file name alone.

Schema versions MUST have clear compatibility meaning:

- additive optional fields MAY be introduced without invalidating older
  consumers when the schema says unknown fields are allowed;
- renamed, removed, or semantically changed required fields MUST use a new
  schema version;
- consumers SHOULD preserve unknown fields unless the schema explicitly permits
  dropping them;
- consumers MUST fail safely or mark the artifact unsupported when a required
  schema version is unknown;
- artifacts SHOULD record the artifact revision or update point separately from
  the schema version when both matter.

Portable contracts MAY define shared schemas. Project-local extensions,
adapters, sync tools, and evidence-packing tools MAY define their own schemas,
but those schemas MUST NOT be treated as portable core doctrine unless a
portable contract explicitly adopts them.

## Audience And Consumer Expectations

An artifact MUST state who or what is expected to consume it. The consumer
description SHOULD be specific enough to prevent accidental reuse outside the
artifact's scope.

Artifact consumers MAY rely only on claims that are:

1. within the artifact's stated purpose;
2. supported by provenance and evidence references when evidence is required;
3. not contradicted by the artifact's limitations or validation claims;
4. within the ownership layer that produced the artifact.

An artifact MUST NOT imply that adapter-specific, project-local, or sync-tool
behavior is portable merely because the artifact references the portable core.

## Provenance Expectations

Artifact provenance MUST describe the origin of material claims at the level
needed for review. It SHOULD include:

- source artifacts, source files, or source evidence used;
- whether the artifact was created from inspection, transformation, generation,
  maintainer confirmation, or a combination of sources;
- the relevant freshness or observation point;
- important assumptions, exclusions, or unresolved questions;
- material transformations between source evidence and artifact content.

Provenance MUST NOT require consumers to trust unsupported conversation memory.
If a claim depends on observed evidence, the artifact MUST reference that
evidence or state that evidence is missing, pending, unavailable, or outside
scope.

## Evidence Reference Expectations

Evidence references connect durable artifacts to the observations that support
them. They SHOULD be concise and stable. They MUST avoid embedding unrelated
source material or secret-adjacent details.

An evidence reference SHOULD identify:

- an evidence reference identifier;
- the evidence kind, such as command output, inspected state, CI result, manual
  review, maintainer confirmation, source artifact, or external source;
- the artifact or source locator, using repository-relative paths for files when
  possible;
- the observation or retrieval point when freshness matters;
- a short summary of what the evidence supports;
- any access, redaction, or freshness limitation that affects reuse.

Evidence references are pointers, not evidence-packing instructions. Tooling for
collecting, compressing, redacting, or serializing evidence belongs to the
evidence-packing contract or the relevant adapter.

## Limitations And Uncertainty

Artifacts MUST state material limitations and uncertainty. A limitation is
material when a consumer could make a different decision if they knew it.

Artifacts SHOULD report:

- unverified assumptions;
- unavailable evidence;
- stale or potentially stale source material;
- failed, skipped, pending, or not-required validation;
- maintainer confirmation that covers only part of the artifact;
- known residual risks.

Artifacts MUST NOT omit limitations in order to make a result appear more
certain. Missing validation MUST be represented through the validation vocabulary
in [validation.md](validation.md), not described as success.

## Boundary Rules

Portable artifact rules own durable metadata, provenance, evidence-reference,
audience, schema, and uncertainty expectations.

Portable artifact rules MUST NOT own:

- project-local artifact storage paths, naming conventions, release procedures,
  validation commands, or operational facts;
- adapter-specific template syntax, platform fields, copied payloads, or runtime
  behavior;
- sync metadata such as lock-file entries, managed-file checksums, installed
  adapter records, or update algorithms;
- evidence-packing implementation behavior;
- detailed workflow roles, handoff formats, or orchestration rules;
- evaluation cases, fixtures, scoring rubrics, or datasets.

Project-local conventions belong in `docs/project/**`. Adapter artifacts belong
with the relevant adapter. Sync metadata behavior belongs to the path ownership
and sync safety contract. Evidence-packing behavior belongs in
[evidence-packing.md](evidence-packing.md) or a tool-specific adapter.

## Extension Path

Later artifact work SHOULD extend this file only when adding portable rules that
apply across artifact producers and consumers. Layer-specific artifacts SHOULD
extend the document owned by that layer instead of duplicating portable rules.
